ABSTRACT \\
\end{center}
An abstract of 350 words or less, not including the title, is required for all dissertations, theses and reports. One extra, loose copy of your abstract is required for the library. In addition, an abstract is required as part of the PhD.  If your abstract is longer than 350 words, UMI (the publisher of dissertations) will edit your abstract to 350 words.  It is in your best interest to do the editing yourself to limit it to the 350 words, rather than leave the editing up to someone who does not know your research as you do.  

The abstract should be formatted as it is shown here.  The requirements are as follows:   Title of document on top;  Abstract of document (350 words or fewer); Author's name on bottom; Advisor's name on bottom; Date on bottom; Department at bottom; Degree on bottom; The abstract should be the first page where page numbers appear, starting with page number iii (or page ii if a copyright page is not included). All pages after the abstract up to the first page of the body of the document continue with lower case Roman numerals (iii, iv, v, etc.)

Note: 1 extra, loose copy of your abstract is required for the Library. In addition, an abstract is required as part of the Ph.D defense announcement to be submitted to the Office of the Registrar at least 1Â½ weeks prior to the scheduled date of defense. \\
